        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shawarma is made by marinating thin slices of chicken or beef in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, paprika, and black pepper. The meat is traditionally stacked and slow-roasted on a vertical rotisserie, allowing it to cook evenly while staying juicy and flavorful. As it roasts, thin slices are shaved off for serving.

The cooked meat is then wrapped in soft flatbread or pita with fresh vegetables like lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, and onions. It is usually topped with creamy garlic sauce, tahini, or chili sauce for extra flavor. The result is a warm, savory wrap that is both tender and richly spiced, perfect for a quick and satisfying meal.</p>

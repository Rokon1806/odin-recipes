        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried chicken is made by first marinating chicken pieces in buttermilk or a mixture of yogurt, salt, pepper, garlic, and spices to tenderize and flavor the meat. After marinating for a few hours, the chicken is dredged in seasoned flour—often mixed with paprika, chili powder, and a pinch of baking powder for extra crispiness. Some recipes double-coat the chicken by dipping it back into buttermilk and flour again to create a thicker crust.

The coated chicken is then deep-fried in hot oil (about 170–180°C) until golden brown and cooked through, usually 12–15 minutes depending on the size of the pieces. Once fried, it is placed on a wire rack or paper towel to drain excess oil, resulting in juicy, tender meat inside and a crispy, flavorful crust outside.</p>
